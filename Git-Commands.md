## git init
First you must indicate that a project is going to start using git with `git init`.
```bash
cd Desktop
cd projectFolderName
git init
```
Or you can also right click on the folder >> Git Bash Here >> `git init`

## git status
To find out what status my files are in, use the `git status` command.
The states can be:
- Local
    - On working directory.
    - On staging area.
    - On local repo.
- Remote
    - On remote repo.
```bash
git status
```
## git add <file>
To add the data from the *working directory* to the *staging area*, use `git add nameFile.extent`.
```bash
git add main.cc
```
`git add .` will add all the content of the file

## git commit
To add the data from the *staging area* to the *local repo*, use `git commit -m "a brief description"`.
```bash
git commit -m "first commit"
```
It is recommended that you add a brief description of the changes you made for this commit.
It is necessary the first time to add an email and user name to know which developer makes the commits.
```bash
git config --global user.email "sample.address@gmail.com"
git config --global user.name "Name Surname1 Surname2"
```
## git diff <file>
We can use the `git diff fileName.extent` command to see the differences (changes) that have occurred in the code file.
- \+ added
- \- removed
```bash
git status
git diff main.cc
```
## git checkout - - <file>
Returns the code to an earlier version than the current one in status. We can do this using the `git checkout --fileName.extent` command.
```bash
git checkout --main.cc
```
## git log
If you want to save the code that differentiates each commit so that you can reverse the changes to that version in the future, use `git log`.
```bash
git log
```
It includes:
- A hash of the version.
- The author's name.
- The author's email.
- The date the commit was made.

## git push
To move the data from the *local repo* to the *remote repo*, use `git push`.
```bash
git push
```
## git clone <http address>
To make a copy from the central server where all the code files are to your computer to start working. Use: `git clone https://github.com/UserName/ProjectName`.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DanielRam94m/My-CC-Notes
```
## git pull
In case several developers are working on the same remote repository, the `git pull` command brings you the changes that other developers have made.
```bash
git pull
```
When it is the first time you do a git pull you could consider doing a `git pull origin`
```bash
git pull origin
```
## git branch
```bash
git branch -a
```
## git checkout <branch>
If you want to move from one branch to another use `git checkout branchName`
```bash
git checkout dev-a
git checkout dev-b
git checkout master
```
## git fetch <repository>
Fetch all of the branches from the repository. This also downloads all of the required commits and files from the other repository
```bash
git fetch master
```
## git merge
To make a merge we move to the branch we want to save the changes and use the command `git merge branchSourceName`, where branchSouceName is the name of the branch from which we will merge in.
```bash
git checkout master
git merge dev-b
```
If at the time of "merge" there are conflicts (two different versions of the same part of the code between both branches) we do the necessary changes and then we use the `git add .` command, so the changes will be moved to the *staging area*.
```bash
git linea de memes
```
Now we can do a `git commit "A brief description"`.
You could do a `git log --oneline` in order to check if everything looks fine and there is not more conflicts.
```bash
git log --oneline
```
And then you can do a `git push`.
